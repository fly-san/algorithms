List of common or interesting algorithms I've stumbled upon

Note: I've found the best way to learn things to me is to attempt to explain them to someone else. 
However, I have no credentials whatsoever to be explaining anything within this repository. 

This is simply a personal project, if you are able to learn anything at all from it, that's great :)
